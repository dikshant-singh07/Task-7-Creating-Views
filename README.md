# Day 7: Creating Views – SQL Developer Internship

This task focuses on creating and using **SQL Views** to encapsulate complex queries for easier reuse, abstraction, and control.

---

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

- Creating Views from single/multiple tables
- Using views for simplification and abstraction
- Performing updates through simple views
- Dropping views

---

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Views with joins and `GROUP BY` are **not updatable**
- Simple views over one table **can be updated**
- Views do **not store data**, they store SQL logic
